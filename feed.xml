<h2 id="trying-to-create-a-profitable-project-alone">Trying to create a profitable project alone</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve spent most of my time between summer and christmas 2020 working on <a href="https://krets.app">Krets</a>. The project was 
my first real attempt at creating a commercially viable service on my own. While the project isn&#39;t dead, I&#39;ve now started focusing on other projects for a while. </p>
<p>This post covers some of the things I I&#39;ve learned while working on Krets. </p>
<h2 id="dont-make-me-think-or-frankly-do-anything">Don&#39;t make me think! (or, frankly, do anything)</h2>
<p>Most people, i.e. potential customers, really don&#39;t like having to figure out how to use your software.
I thought knew this after reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think">Steve Krugh&#39;s <em>Don&#39;t make me think</em></a> years ago. 
I didn&#39;t. </p>
<p>Krets was primarily targeted at businesses, meaning that I&#39;ve been talking a lot to owners of small businesses. 
They have a lot on their mind already. Everything not core to their business is a distraction unless 
the rewards for them materialize themselves quickly. This means: minimal setup and minimal distruption 
to their existing flow is essential. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve experienced potential customers don&#39;t even want to spend the time to create an account, but would 
rather have me do it. These were otherwise excited customers who showed initiative. 
This happened on several occations. </p>
<p>So the lesson is: People are not going to spend time on you or your project. 
Even if they see value in what you&#39;re offering, they don&#39;t care until the value is actually there. 
They don&#39;t find the project in itself interesting, like you do. </p>
<p>This was (still is, if I&#39;m being honest) hard to internalize because I am 
the oposite. I am curious to learn about software and play around with every user-setting I can find. 
I guess that&#39;s why I ended up writing software.</p>
<p>Also, if something else has to be handled (like idk, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">a pandemic</a>) 
you&#39;re the first thing going off their todo-list. Understandably so :)</p>
<h2 id="time-is-worth-a-lot-of-money">Time is worth a lot of money</h2>
<p>When I started this project, I found myself with relatively little money, 
but a lot of time. Krets required a lot of skills I did not have, nor had 
the money to buy from someone else. Like marketing-, sales- and design skills. </p>
<p>I thought this was OK. Money and time are just two sides of the same coin. 
Since I had a lot of it, I could just throw time at the problem, instead of money. 
While I still believe this to be mostly true, I drastically underestimated how much 
time is required for... everything. Ironic really, since that&#39;s the one thing 
everyone tells everyone about every project ever. </p>
<p>I did everything: marketing, cold-calling potential customers, organize meetings and try to get funding, 
as well as actually implementing the product. </p>
<p>I&#39;m very happy to have this experience of being responsible for- and doing everything.
It just did not pay off for the project this time :-) </p>
<h2 id="having-friends-is-a-must">Having friends is a must</h2>
<p>I have been working on Krets alone. However, I&#39;ve been lucky to have a couple friends 
around. Dedicating time to talking about your thoughts with someone is key. 
Having someone to talk to about what&#39;s on your mind is very helpful for separating
out the constructive and good thoughs from the messy inners of your brain. </p>
<p>These sessions can be scheduled, informal lunches or a meeting with a specific topic. 
Try to make it a regular thing. The times I did this were way easier to deal with 
than the times where I didn&#39;t. </p>
<h2 id="thank-you-for-reading-this">Thank you for reading this</h2>
<p>I hope these thoughts can be of help for someone else. <br/>
Regardless, thank you for taking the time to read. <br/>
Blogging is a strange beast that I&#39;m still trying to figure out. <br/></p>

<p>I want to create a theme for myself. Some do this for a year. I am not sure if a year is the correct amount of time. 
Years are so engrained in everything, and they are everywhere. I think coupling a theme with a year would create 
unnecessary levels of stress when the year is coming to a close. 
And stress is not something that I want. </p>
<p>The idea of themes come - as far as I’m concerned - from CGP Grey and Myke Hurley on the the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex podcast</a>. 
Although comparable to a new years resolution, a theme is more broad. Myke described it as “a north star” while Grey thought 
of it as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">Daemon</a> process for the brain” (both paraphrased from memory). </p>
<p>In addition to being more broad, there is no fail state. Themes may change or turn out to be wrong. 
That’s not failure. On the contrary, it’s an achievement. It is recognising one was mistaken, and 
attempting to make adjustments in time. </p>
<p>I believe this comes from their less concrete and broad nature. New years resolutions are paths that must
be followed. Themes are just lighting up the different paths ahead of you. </p>
<p>So - creation. What do I mean by that? I am not sure, but I am writing to find out. 
What follows is a description of my starting point. </p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>I am coming close to finishing my bachelors degree, and I do not yet have any concrete plans for what to do next. 
The past two and a half years I have been very focused on studies. That was a deliberate decision, and I am happy it was made. 
The past two and a half years have been the best of my youth/adult life. </p>
<p>What made them great? I never quite came to terms with high school. I started to study right after leaving the place.
A major quality of life improvement after the change was that i finally had gained control of my own time. 
I still had (have) to attend some lectures during the week, but just the fact that no one makes me go there 
(i.e. there is no punishment for not going) makes <em>all</em> the difference. In addition, lectures only make up ~8 hours 
every week, meaning that a large majority of the time is spent exactly as I see fit. This allows customisation of my 
work environment on a level that I have previously only been able to dream of. </p>
<p>I have also tried myself down the path of consulting and self employment; a bumpy, but enjoyable ride that I think has a 
lot of potential, given attention and a thoughtful approach. </p>
<p>During this time, I have had relatively clear goals in mind. Wether it was getting a job, getting good grades, 
getting experience being self employed or getting the bachelors degree. </p>
<p>With one exception, these goals have been reached. I still have half a year to - hopefully - get the degree. 
I am relieved that things have mostly gone my way. I have to find new goals. Goals keep me going and give me some 
sense of purpose. But that presupposes that the goals are good. Good goals brings purpose, bad ones do not. </p>
<h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>
<p>I have been told that I seem most happy when I have projects that I am working on, and when I am creating things. 
This is a false perception, though not strictly untrue. I would not say that I become happy. Rather, I become engaged. 
Engagement is keeping me away from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy">apathy</a>, which in turn would make me unhappy. </p>
<p>My largest problem going forward is figuring out what to do after getting my bachelors degree. That struggle is not 
what this write-up is about. However, the theme is probably going to affect the way I view my options going forward 
and therefore relevant. I want to be self-driven, and I want to create something that I believe has inherent value. </p>
<p>In fact, I have some unexplainable urge to do something and express myself. Some people describe some irrational 
need to express themselves. I’m not sure it is irrational. It is more appropriate to call it moment-driven. And I want more of it. This is a real aspect of me, but it is sometimes neglected. 
The other part of me wants to make the “correct” and “reasonable” choices. The safe choice, that will guarantee a stable future. 
These two parts are in conflict with each other. I need them not to be. </p>
<p>These parts have strengths and weaknesses. The rational “play safe”-part of me should be allowed to dominate sometimes. 
During the time leading up to an exam or making me go through slides before the lecture. </p>
<p>The latter part has a tendency to dominate, and that has often been a huge benefit. But the moment-driven part of me 
is responsible for some decisions that I am very happy with. For example, studying Computer Science at a private university 
college known for being alternative and “creative”. This went agains almost all the advice I received, urging me towards a 
public, safe university. However, I am almost certain that I made the correct choice. Trusting some gut feeling has worked 
for me at times when the path has not been clear.</p>
<p>When goals are clear (e.g. before an upcoming exam), I <em>should</em> make reasonable and safe decisions. But without the clear 
goal, “want to” may be wiser than “should”. The difficulty lies in figuring out when to follow what side. As I am starting 
to lack concrete goals, I believe that I am at a similar point now. I should repeat the success I achieved when choosing between schools. </p>
<p>The difficult part about moment-driven side is that is is very unpredictable. It surfaces from time to time, and usually 
gives good insight. It may in fact give new goals. This is the reason I want to chase it in the upcoming season. </p>
<p>But how am I to chase it? How can it be provoked? I have to deviate slightly from the safe paths, and allow myself to 
focus on following the urges more than I have been doing in the past. And I think this can be done through creation. 
“Creation” is a broad term. 
Specifically, I am referring to the act of making things that feel meaningful to me at the time of creation, without 
necessarily thinking in the long term. </p>
<p>The bachelor project I will be working on is a large project, but it is just <em>one</em> project. My guess is that this will 
allow me to focus on more things as well, regardless of the bachelor projects size. Hopefully, I will have more space in my brain. </p>
<p>Exploration through creation is the key of the theme, in search of new goals. </p>
<h2 id="concretely">Concretely</h2>
<p>Themes are meant to guide, not dictate. My plan going forward is to create what I want when I want to. 
And seek opportunities for creation. </p>
<ul>
<li>Whims should be embraced before being criticised. </li>
<li>Exploration should be encouraged, also when doing school work. </li>
<li>Follow the moment-driven urges to create when it surfaces. </li>
<li>Creations should be valued, regardless of career and academic value </li>
</ul>
<p>Reaching new goals is the purpose, and this is an attempt at an approach.   </p>

<h2 id="thoughts-before">Thoughts before</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been getting increasingly into riding my bike over 
the past year. From not being a very active person at 
all I&#39;m now able to cover some moderate distances on my 
bike relatively fast. Fun! </p>
<p>It&#39;s getting cold and dark. It&#39;s way below 0 degrees outside
and it will remain so for the next months. 
It also gets dark long before 
I am done with work. Cycling around town and exploring 
is fun. However I&#39;ve found it hard to 
be motivated for regular exercise sessions on my bike. </p>
<p>I need to try something different to stay active. 
Earlier this week I impulsively signed up for a gym 
membership for the month of December. </p>
<p>I intend to give jogging on treadmills a serious go
and to create a log of my experience here. 
Treadmills are tedious and the other people at the 
gym make me a bit nervous. So why do this? </p>
<p>First of all, getting out of my comfort zone is 
only good for me. Second of all, it&#39;s a project
and I enjoy having projects :) </p>
<h2 id="daily-log">Daily log</h2>
<h3 id="day-one">Day one</h3>
<p>I was starting to get bored. Can&#39;t let that happen!
So I impulsively signed up for a gym and thought I&#39;d 
try jogging. </p>
<p>Arrived at 19:00. The gym was larger than I expected.
Many people and loud music. On the second floor I 
found a room with no music and mostly treadmills.
Should work. </p>
<p>Turned on a podcast and did on-and-off jogging for 
45-60 minutes. I&#39;m feeling surprisingly OK, if a 
little bit bored with the static view. </p>
<p>My feet got irritated and red, and quite painful.
They&#39;re obviously not used to running.</p>
<h3 id="day-two">Day two</h3>
<p>Arrived at 21:15, 45 minutes before closing. 
Very few people! That&#39;s great! I could pick
exactly the treadmill I wanted to, in a safe 
corner. </p>
<p>Jogged on-and-off until they closed. 
I felt alright, but I found it a bit harder to 
keep up today compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>Jogging is clearly different from cycling!
It&#39;s much heavier in every way. Thus far 
I&#39;m finding it harder to get into a flow. 
Hopefully this gets easier over time. </p>
<p>Both of my feet developed some serious blisters.
I bought some gel plasters on the way home, 
drained the blisters and applied the plasters 
before going to bed. </p>
<h3 id="day-three">Day three</h3>
<p>Unfortunately one of the blisters got really painful, 
woke me up and kept me awake several times during the 
night. No fun. I (naively?) did not expect that. </p>
<p>I was set on heading to the gym, but my better 
half advised me to take one rest day and recover before 
I make things worse. She was right. </p>
<p>Walking is hard after sitting still and I&#39;m feeling 
very sore. I&#39;m not too worried about that, I think 
my body just has to adjust to this new way of moving. </p>
<h3 id="day-four">Day four</h3>
<p>I went to the gym at 20:00 and spent most 
of the upcoming hour on the treadmill. I 
was able to run for noticeably longer than 
earlier before turning to walking speeds. </p>
<p>My blisters have started to heal, but are 
still very present. They&#39;re not as painful
anymore though. The soreness I felt afterwards 
moved more to the sides of my legs compared 
to earlier days. </p>
<p>Later in the evening my nose started 
bleeding. This is fairly common for me, so
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s connected to the running 
or not.</p>
<p>Interestingly this was the first night
where running on the treadmill no longer felt 
completely novel. Rather, it is approaching 
a feeling I would associate with the norm. 
Quicker than I expected! </p>
<h3 id="day-five">Day five</h3>
<p>I&#39;m finally starting to get somewhere close 
to achieving &quot;the zone&quot; I can get into when
riding my bike. I&#39;m still far away, but noticeably 
less so. </p>
<p>I arrived at 19:00 and did 2x10 minutes of 
jogging and then 2x5 minutes, all with relatively 
fast walking in between. This is roughly what 
I have been doing the other days as well, but 
it&#39;s starting to feel more solid and it comes 
a bit easier. </p>
<p>My foot started to hit the ground a bit differently 
today. I&#39;m wondering if this is an automated 
response to the blisters. Those haven&#39;t quite 
healed yet. The soreness is no longer painful
in the same way as before. Just present. It&#39;s 
also moved further to the sides of my legs. </p>
<h3 id="day-six">Day six</h3>
<p>After arriving around 15:00, I noticed 
instant pain in my foot when I started to 
run. Walking had been strange all day, but 
somehow I thought it would disappear when I 
started to run. </p>
<p>Because of this I sat on an exercise 
bikes instead. This was still good exercise and 
my foot didn&#39;t hurt at all. Great! 
Riding on a still-standing bike was boring. 
I missed the road. Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_2021">World 
Chess Championship</a>
helped a bunch :) </p>
<h3 id="day-seven">Day seven</h3>
<p>In order to make some pre-arranged plans I arrived 
much earlier than I usually do. And my foot was 
fine again! No pain. So I went back to running :) </p>
<p>This day went similar to <a href="#day-five">day five</a>. That&#39;s 
good! Day seven also feels a bit like a milestone. 
I&#39;m not celebrating anything until the end though.  </p>
<h3 id="day-eight">Day eight</h3>
<p>Arrived around 20:00 in the evening. 
I&#39;d had too much to eat for dinner and clearly 
payed for that when running. </p>
<p>I had slightly longer breaks of walking than 
I usually do and ran for 2x10 minutes and 1x5, which 
is 5 minutes less than the other days. 
I&#39;m not feeling too bad about it, but I 
can return stronger next time!</p>
<h3 id="day-nine">Day nine</h3>
<p>This evening was spent working on my bike.
That is fixing it, not riding. Being a hopeless amateur
bike mechanic is fun sometimes, but usually 
takes a lot of time. </p>
<p>I also ate a lot of liquorice and drank a liter 
of chocolate milk while making dinner. 
I probably shouldn&#39;t mention this since I&#39;m 
sort of documenting exercise, but it feels
a bit disingenuous to leave it out. </p>
<h3 id="day-ten">Day ten</h3>
<p>I arrived at 18:00 today. 
I did 3x10 minutes. That has become 
the &quot;mark of success&quot; at this point, so 
I am happy :)  </p>
<p>I took off the plasters earlier because 
everything looked and felt fine again. 
Unfortunately one of the blisters flared 
up again today, and I applied new ones 
as a result. </p>
<p>Things felt tough when I was running, but 
when I look back at it, I feel like the time 
passed relatively quickly!</p>
<h3 id="day-eleven">Day eleven</h3>
<p>Another day of 3x10 minutes! 
Running felt easier today, and 
time flew by with some fun podcasts. </p>
<h3 id="day-twelve">Day twelve</h3>
<p>I had plans today and I did not 
have time to run after work. The plans 
involved playing padel, so at least 
some activity was involved :) </p>
<h3 id="day-thirteen">Day thirteen</h3>
<p>Played padel today as well, but since 
this was a saturday I had time to run 
as well :-) I did 20 minutes of continuos 
running and then ten more after a break! 
That is the longest yet and it feels like a 
step up from the usual 3x10.</p>
<p>There were few people at the gym; I 
had the place almost to myself. I addition, 
getting to and from the padel court
involved some uphill cycling on 
snowy roads. What a day!</p>
<h3 id="day-fourteen">Day fourteen</h3>
<p>Another day of 3x10 minutes. This was fun.
Running starts to feel very normal. I actually 
like it, more than I expected to at the very least. </p>
<p>This time I was listening ot music instead of 
podcasts. This was an interesting change. I thought 
it would bore me, but my head had enough going on 
on its own. Coming to think of it, that is why I 
listen to podcasts in the first place; it makes my 
brain shut up, at least partially. </p>
<h3 id="day-fifteen">Day fifteen</h3>
<p>My legs are hurting a lot. And for some reason they 
are painfully stinging when I try to get up from a 
squatting position or otherwise putting a lot of 
weight on my right knee. Not good. My foot also 
feels like it is lightly sprained. </p>
<p>I think a rest day is much needed. Luckily I am practically
drowning in work to keep me occupied today. </p>
<h3 id="day-sixteen">Day sixteen</h3>
<p>I am afraid that the pain is similar to yesterday. I will
continue staying away from running. I am still cycling to work though. 
Cycling does not seem to trigger the pain. Furhthermore, it is not long 
to the office. I do not thing it will have a negative impact on my 
recovery. </p>
<p>I have started doing stretching exercises. I now realize that I should 
have done this from the beginning. Obvious in hindsight. Oh well, 
at least I am learning. </p>
<p>Hopefully this will get better soon.</p>
<h3 id="day-seventeen">Day seventeen</h3>
<p>The pain is slowly but surely getting better :) 
I am still doing stretching exercises during the day 
and staying away from running. </p>
<p>In addition to not stretching properly, I now see 
that I have not been good enough at starting slowly 
and getting properly warmed up. I have usually done 
around 2-5 minutes of walking before attempting to run. 
In hindsight that does not seem like enough. Another 
learning point I guess. </p>
<p>I will keep at this resting and healing for as long 
as needed. I feel a bit sheepish for putting myself 
in this position. Again: learning the hard way :) </p>
<h3 id="day-eighteen">Day eighteen</h3>
<p>My knee is getting better and so is my foot. 
There is still some pain, but nothing compared to just 
two days ago. That is great! </p>
<p>I am a bit sorry this whole running thing did not go as expected. 
I really learned a lot in a short amount of time, however! 
The importance of stretching and starting slow, for 
one thing. I also learned that running is very hard on 
the body; I have not had anything close to these kinds of 
issues when cycling. </p>
<p>I played padel again today and really enjoyed it. 
My legs and general soreness is holding me back a 
bit, but not enough to remove the fun from it. </p>
<h2 id="thoughts-after">Thoughts after</h2>
<p>This has been some interesting weeks. For one thing, 
I discovered that running can be alright. I also learned 
a lot about some of the mistakes one can make when 
starting out. All things I kind of thought I knew. And 
all things I was warned about by people close to me. 
This shows that I can be a bit stubborn and sometimes 
need to learn something for myself to actually understand 
and take i seriously. Although often advantageous, this 
mindset definitely has some drawbacks as well :) </p>
<p>I am happy that I exposed myself to something new, made 
some mistakes and learned from it :) </p>

<p><em>NOTE</em>: This post is out of date, as the site is <a href="./how_this_site_works.md">updated</a>.
<em>NOTE</em>: This post was renamed from &quot;site&quot; to &quot;initial site&quot;</p>
<p>This is my website. I have iterated on it many times. 
Although I have made many attempts at making it look
good and stylish, I have never gotten to something that 
I like. However, my belief is that I am closer now than 
ever before.</p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>My approach is simply to keep it as simple as possible. 
I am certainly not alone in this; a lot of people have 
very simple websites, focusing solely on content. We 
are talking <em>properly simple</em>. No styling or anything.
Just plain HTML-tags with content.</p>
<p>This means that the page fails or succeeds based on the 
cotnent alone. Because - quite frankly - content is all 
that is available. Realising that styling is not what I 
want to spend time doing, I have done something similar. </p>
<p>Even if the content quality to warrant such an approach 
is not there. </p>
<h2 id="general-setup">General setup</h2>
<p>I am currently writing in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. 
More specifically, I am using <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx">MDX</a>, 
which seems to combine the pleasentness of Markdowns minimal syntax 
with the usefulness of <a href="reactjs.org">React</a> and its components.</p>
<p>For building site itself, I am using <a href="https://nextjs.org">NextJS</a>. 
The process has been surprisingly straightforward. Writing in
markdown and automatically receving quite nice webpages on the other 
end is a delight. The app is deployed with <a href="zeit.co">now</a>. I had 
some domain-related issues, but that was mainly confusion on my part. </p>

<p>Or rather: how I got rid of bloated setup and just wrote markdown. </p>
<p>When I first built this site almost a year ago, <a href="olaven.org/out/site.html">I was pretty 
happy</a> with my setup. It was built with 
<a href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJS</a>, hosted with <a href="https://zeit.co/home">Zeit now</a> and 
the pages were written in <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a> and styled with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.
A pretty huge pipeline is needed in order to get this to stick together. </p>
<p>However, the site itself was literally just as basic as the site you are looking 
at right now (as of march, 2020). Why is such a complicated setup needed? Of 
course, it is not. But I knew NextJS pretty well, had gotten familiar with Sass and 
I really wanted to write using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. 
What I wanted was achieved: a homepage I could update by writing markdown. However, I 
could not quite get past the fact that there was so much setup needed for such a basic thing.</p>
<p>Markblog is my attempt at a solution. It is a small piece of software written in <a href="deno.land">Deno</a>. 
It simply converts markdown to HTML, and packages it in a nice, tiny, non-bloated blog-like page. 
As of writing, the default file structure is as follows:  </p>
<ul>
<li><code>index.md</code></li>
<li><code>style.css</code></li>
<li><code>posts/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>(create this automatically with Markblog&#39;s <code>init</code>-command)</p>
<p>The index page shows the markdown-text in addition to links to posts, in addition to the content 
written in <code>index.md</code>. Then, Markblog&#39;s <code>build</code>-command triggers conversion to html. In my setup, 
this runs as part of a simple CI-pipeline, meaning that I never touch anything other than Markdown-files. </p>

<p>I dag har jeg laget meg et lite eventyr. Samboeren min drar i dag, klokken 10.
Faktisk er det ganske viktig at hun drar klokken ti. Hun skal ta tog.
Tidspunkt er ganske viktig når man tar tog.</p>
<p>Det er kanskje derfor mange foretrekker å reise med bil.
Men min samboer foretrekker allikevel å ta tog. Jeg foretrekker for
øvrig å ta tog jeg også. Og da er altså, som sagt, tidspunkt viktig.
Tidspunktet har ikke så mye å si for meg, vel og merke. Jeg skal ikke ta tog.
Jeg har pakket sekken.</p>
<p>Sekken var og er en passe stor, lett tursekk. I den har jeg lagt en hengekøye, en tarp, et liggeunderlag,
ullundertøy, noen teltplugger og en vannflaske. I tilleggg har jeg pakket en Ipad, en kindle og en telefon.
Disse tre tingene visste jeg ikke helt om jeg ville ha med eller ikke. 
Særlig Ipaden.</p>
<p>En stor del av meg mener at eventyr helst bør gjøres uten slike digitale dingser. Det ideelle eventyret et 
analogt pusterom. En pause fra den ellers så digitale og masete hverdagene vi
mer eller mindre frivillig har laget oss og lever i. En slags distraksjon fra distraksjonene.
Jeg etterlever det sjeldent. Men det er iallfall en tanke jeg har.</p>
<p>Under tidligere eventyr har jeg etterstrebet dette analoge idealet.
Men det går aldri helt. Telefonen innbiller jeg meg at jeg ikke klarer meg uten. Den ser jeg på som en forsikring. 
Jeg kan bruke den til å kontakte nødetater og tilsvarende. Eldre mennesker enn meg som deler samme analoge eventyrideal 
vil kanskje si at den ikke faktisk er nødvendig. De har nok rett. Men dette har jeg ikke klart å internalisere.
Den har iallfall blitt med meg hver gang.</p>
<p>Når telefonen først er med, har idealet en tendens til å vike for impulsene i øyeblikket. 
Eventyrets stillhet, og roen jeg alltid romantiserer i frokant blir for mye og for fremmed.
Hjernen min er vant til konstant stimuli. Litt av alt, hele tiden, takk! Litt av alt, og alt for mye å trives i skogen.
Etter hvert gir jeg altså etter, og mater hjernen min med akkurat det den vil ha. Inndata. Podcasts, for eksempel.
&quot;Apathy&#39;s a tragedy and boredom is a crime&quot;, slik komikeren Burnham synger.</p>
<p>Hva om jeg for en gangs skyld sier at det ikke er så farlig? Hva om jeg tar med meg teknologien og atpåtil tillater meg å bruke den. Hva skjer da?
Må det være så nøye? Ville jeg få det bedre om jeg ikke stadig anstrengte meg for å leve opp til det analoge idealet? Eller til syvende og sist 
ha dårlig samvittighet for at jeg gir etter? 
Disse tankene fløy gjennom hodet mitt i det samboeren min dro for å rekke toget klokken ti. &quot;Hade&quot;, sier hun mens hun gir meg en god klem. 
Det er fint. Snart er det min tur til å gå ut døren.</p>
<p>Jeg plukker opp sekken og ser meg rundt i rommet. Herregud, soveposen ligger enda på gulvet! Jeg får såvidt plass øverst i sekken. 
Nå er den ubalansert. Sekken altså. Det liker jeg ikke. Alt for tung i toppen. Sekken må definitivt pakkes om. 
Det må være balanse i tingene.
Jeg pakker om og noen minutter senere er tingene balansert. Plassen er bedre utnyttet og sekken er ikke lenger like stappfull. 
Supert.</p>
<p>Omsider er jeg ute av leiligheten. Gamle Oslo er nydelig. Kanskje byens peneste bydel, spør du meg. Men jeg og sekken setter kursen for sentrum.
Strengt tatt er det litt rart å sette kursen fra Gamle Oslo til sentrum. Jeg antar de fleste vil mene at Gamle Oslo er en del av sentrum. 
Med &quot;sentrum&quot; mener jeg derimot Sentrum. Sentrum-sentrum, om du skjønner. Og det tror jeg du gjør.</p>
<p>Byen har begynt å våkne. Kafeene har begynt å fylles opp av gjester. Noen av dem jobber. Andre snakker. De som er her nå har sikkert kommet tidlig for å sikre seg favorittplassene sine. Luringer. 
Matbodene har akkurat begynt å lage dagens første runde med mat. Før folkemengdene kommer for alvor. Da satser jeg 
på å være borte for lengst.</p>
<p>Planen min med å gå i Sentrum-sentrum var å se etter sovepose i en sportsbutikk. Ikke fordi det er noe galt med den jeg har, men
fordi den ikke er min. Jeg bare låner den. Dessuten er den akkurat litt for stor til å få plass i min alt for dyre sykkelbag.
Alt som ikke egner seg på sykkel får straks et lite minus i min bok. Utvalget sporstforetningene Storgata og Bogstadveien byr på 
skuffer meg, mens det er ikke så farlig. Jeg skal ikke sykle i dag. I dag skal jeg gå, gå på eventyr. 
Og omveier i Sentrum-sentrum til tross, er jeg allerede godt på vei riktig retning.</p>
<p>Jeg går i jevnt tempo fra Bogstadveien til Ullevål Hageby. Derfra krysser jeg Ring 3 over den relativt nye sykkel- og gangbroen 
som er der. Den ble bygget da jeg bodde i området for noen år siden. Jeg har gått og syklet masse her, fra Ullevål og
opp bakkene til Kringsjå. Det er en rar følelse å være på et sted hvor man har vært så mye, men allikevel ikke lenger har noe å gjøre. </p>
<p>Flere ganger tar jeg meg i å savne sykkelen min. Det er fint å gå, men hastigheten på sykkel er den som passer meg best. Mer
action på en måte, men fortsatt med måtehold og uten motor. Det e fint å merke at jeg savner
transportmetoden jeg bruker mest tid på.</p>
<p>Jeg går inn på matbutikken på Kringsjå. Det er siste stopp før skogen. Jeg skal ikke langt, så jeg behøver ikke 
tenke noe særlig på hva jeg kjøper. Planen er å bare ta bæreposen i hånden. Vekt og plass i sekken er ikke så nøye. 
Vanligvis pleier jeg å ha ganske konkrete planer før jeg går inn i en butikk, men ikke denne gangen. Eventyret kan ha noen 
slike momenter, tenker jeg. Momenter som ikke er planlagt, men som bare skjer. Maten ville fått de fleste ernæringsfysiologer 
til å rynke på nesen. To enkle salatblandinger med laks, to poser potetgull, en smoothie og en pose lakris ligger i handleposen 
min når jeg er ferdig, utenfor butikken på Kringsjå Studentby. </p>
<p>Fra Kringsjå er det bare 5 minutters gange til Sognsvann. Fra Sognsvann er det bare 10 minutters gange til Svartkulp.
Hovedstiene er usaklig tilrettelagte. De ligner mer på grusveier enn stier til tider. Ikke misforstå meg. Jeg klager
ikke på tilgjengelig natur. Men jeg synes at det er påfallende hver gang jeg er her.</p>
<p>Jeg velger ikke veien jeg nettop beskrev, men følger en annen slik tilrettelagt sti et stykke før jeg tar av inn i det
evige stinettet som er i skogen, i retning Svartkulp.</p>
<p>Stinettet snor seg innover. Jeg tenker på alle som bruker dette området. Da jeg bodde her, frekventerte jeg området og 
var en av de mange som brukte dette området til rekreasjon. Tenk på alle som gjør det, tenker jeg; bruker dette området 
til rekreasjon, altså. Alle timene og alle skrittene som bokstavelig talt er lagt ned i jorden. Hvor har alle de timene blitt av? 
Hvor ble mine timer av? Kan det ha kommet noe nyttig ut av dette? Det er vanskelig å komme på nyttige
ting som blir gjort her. Det vil si, å gå i skogen kan definitivt ha en nytte for noe annet. Angivelig er det blant annet veldig
godt for både psykisk og fysisk helse. Og god helse er nødvendig for å mestre andre arenaer i livet.</p>
<p>Skogvokteren gjør sikkert noe nyttig når han går her. Det er ikke helt klart for meg verken hvorvidt skogvoktere fremdeles finnes
eller hva de gjør. Skogvoktere har et forbedringspotensial på markedsføring, konkluderer jeg. Jeg tipper, kanskje fordomsfult, at den
gjennosmtnittlige skogvokter ikke har særlig mye til overs for markedsføring. </p>
<p>Spørsmålet om nytte kommer tilbake til meg. 
For det første, kunne ikke god helse være bra nok i seg selv? Hvorfor er god helse bare godt fordi det muliggjør andre ting?
Karriere, økonomi og gode venner. Er ikke disse tingene også bare nyttige fordi de igjen gjør andre ting enklere? En karriere,
for eksempel, er da ikke et mål i seg selv? For noen er karriere nyttig for å tjene penger til å ta vare på de rundt seg. Men 
hva er så galt med at det ikke går så bra med de rundt en, <em>egentlig</em>? Er det fordi vi opplever sorg? Hvorfor er sorg så ille?
Det gjør vondt og kan i ytterste konsekvens ta livet av oss. Eller kanskje det er riktigere å snu på det: Det å miste de rundt 
seg er ikke farlig fordi det å miste noen er en enorm ulempe. Det nyttige er kanskje at det å ha folk rundt seg er en fordel. 
De som har folk rundt seg, har høyere sjans for å overleve fordi de ikke er alene om utfordringene, men kan samarbeide om dem. 
Ja vel, men er det så nøye det da? Karriere er nyttig for ikke å ta vare på folk rundt seg, som igjener nyttig for å ikke miste dem, 
som igjen er nyttig for egen overlevese. Overlevelse er nyttig for å bringe videre egne gener, som nå enten fremstår som totalt 
meningsløst eller er nyttig for noe nytt igjen.</p>
<p>Finnes det noe som er nyttig eller eller ønskelig som ikke er det fordi det hjelper en med den neste såkalt nyttige tingen?
Det hele blir til en evig rekursiv tankerekke av nyttighet og mål. Som et dataprogram som kjører seg selv om og om igjen - 
et evig tankeprogram som krasjer hodet mitt om det får fortsette.</p>
<p>Det aner meg at dette fort kan utvikle seg til et &quot;Hva er poenget med noe som helst&quot;-type spørsmål. Den tankerekken må jeg
skru av. Hodet mit håndterer slike ideer dårlig på en vanlig dag. I dag, på eventur alene, kan et slikt reskursivt program
i hodet bli fullstendig ødelegegnde.</p>
<p>Svartkulp er endelig på min venstre hånd. Her har jeg tenk til å slå leir. Kartet har imidlertid gjort meg oppmerksom på
at det ligger et lite vann rett vest for Svartkulp. Der har jeg ikke vært før, men det er ikke langt. Bare 200m eller noe
slikt.</p>
<p>Vannet har ikke noe navn på kartet. Senere har jeg funnet ut at det går under to navn: Lille Svartkulp og Langmyrskulp.
Med denne informasjonen er det ganske intuitivt at Langmyr er en myr øst for Svartkuulp, som blant annet inneholder et lite
vann. Dessuten er den lang. Dette viser seg å stemme. </p>
<p>Derimot er det ikke like intuitivt at den en gang ble brukt som skytebane. Jeg skjønner at den kan  ha egnet seg til det, for 
den er lang og flat. Men akkurat hvilken funksjon vannet hadde på en skytebane ser jeg ikke. Det virker upraktisk 
å måtte forholde seg til et vann når man egentlig er ute etter å treffe blinker. Eller kanskje, men forhåpentligvis ikke, noe annet.</p>
<p>Med det sagt vil kulene naturligvis fly over vannet. så da er det kanskje ikke i veien allikevel. Jeg begynner å lefle med tanken på å
slå leir der istedenfor her. Saken blir avgjort i det jeg blir oppmerksom på alle stemmene rundt vannet. Over alt langs
Svartkups vannkant er det folk på tur. Tilsynelatende flest barnefamilier. Det vil jeg holde meg unna.</p>
<p>Det er ikke noe galt i barnefamilier eller noen av de andre rundt vannet. Tvert imot synes jeg det er fint å se
folk her. Men i dag gjerne være alene. Jeg vil ikke at noen skal komme i veien for meg og, ikke minst, jeg vil ikke
komme i veien for noen andre. Ikke at det er spesielt for i dag. Jeg trives godt med å være alene og ønsker som regel
å være det.</p>
<p>Langmyrskulp står til forventingngene. Overgår dem faktisk. Sant og si var de ikke veldig høye. Det er lite og ovalt,
kanskje 100m langt og 50m bredt. På den andre siden sitter det et menneske i blå allværsjakke og spiser niste. Et
nistespisende menneske skal jeg greie. Vedkomne er nok rolig og snill. Det tror jeg de fleste som spiser niste langs
Langmyrskulp er.</p>
<p>Tidspunktet for å finne ut av hvor jeg skal slå leier har endelig kommet. Det blåser. Ikke veldig mye, men nok til at
jeg vil unngå vinden om jeg kan. Særlig kastene. Jeg går rundt vannet. Det er mange gode kandidater. Men jeg vil finne
det beste stedet.</p>
<p>Langs vestsiden av vannet er det en liten åpning i skogen. Den er liten og ganske mørk. En god backup, tenker jeg for meg selv.
Det er også en liten bekk der. Kartet forteller meg at dette er bekken som kobler dette vannet med Svartkulp. I Nordenden er 
det en liten bålplass. Bortenfor den, på Østsiden, er det mange små trær og ganske åpent. Bak er det en
svært bratt skråning. Denne gir ly for vinden, ser det ut til. Kult!</p>
<p>Nistemennesket sitter der fremdeles, rett bortenfor det kule området. Jeg ønsker ikke å forstyrre, og snur meg og går
rundt vannet, til jeg ankommer startsetedet, i sørenden.</p>
<p>Lyen eksisterer ikke der og underlaget er våtere. Det er god avstand mellom trærne, men utenom det virker sørsiden
som dårlig parti. Jeg går tilbake til nrodsiden. Den snille nistespiseren følger med meg. Eller, det vet jeg ikke sikkert.
Det er en antakelse. Igjen blir jeg nervøs for å forstyre nistespiserens nistepause dersom jeg går for nærme. Så jeg bestemmer
meg for å gi sørenden enda en sjanse, og går tilbake. </p>
<p>Frem og tilbake trasker jeg, mens jeg forsøker å ikke tenke på at nistespiseren sikkert tenker at dette ser litt rart ut. 
Jeg vil virkelig ikke komme i veien. Jeg vil ikke være i nærheten av fremmede nå. Det fyller meg med en vag engstelse og 
sterk uro. Jeg vet ikke hvorfor det er sånn. Det skulle jeg ønske at jeg visste. Eller iallfall skulle jeg ønske at jeg kunne 
skru det av litt lettere enn jeg kan. </p>
<p>Ganske håpløst, jeg vet det. Runddansen rundt vannet rekker å gjenta seg tre ganger før nistespiseren pakker sakene sine i et beundringsværdig
bedagelig tempo og går. Den blå allværsjakken forsvinner opp skråningen. Jeg håper eieren får en fortsatt fin dag.</p>
<p>Omsider slår jeg leir, omtrent der nistespiseresn satt. Leiren kan presenteres slik, ordnet synkende etter avstand fra bakken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tarp, klønete oppspent mellom trær, plugger i bakken i vestsiden og til side ni små busker langs vannet i øst.</li>
<li>Sovepose, fremdeles innpakket. Fungerer foreløpig som nakkepute.</li>
<li>Liggeunderlang. Jeg har ingenting å utsette på dette underlaget. det er fucking supert.</li>
<li>Hengekøye, spent relativt pent mellom to trær. Den ligger litt skjevt i forhold til tarpen, som ødelegger det visuelle inntrykket litt. Eller kanskje er det tarpen som ligger skjevt. Samme det. Jeg bestemmer meg for at dette ikke har særlig å si. Hverken hva som er skjevt i forhold til hva eller at det er skjevt.</li>
<li>Sekken, på bakken. Jeg liker sekken. Den er min følgesvenn. Det er på en måte fellesneveren. Jeg vet ikke hvorfor jeg tenker det.</li>
</ul>
<p>Det er et bra oppsett. Pen utsikt over vannet. Ganske god ly for vinden. Etter en stund med skogslyder setter jeg på en lydbok. På mange måter 
opplever jeg det som roligere. Hvorfor det? Det er rart. Hvorfor lurer jeg jeg på det også? Hodet mitt har som alltid vanskelig for å holde kjeft.
Det er en egenskap jeg er usikker på om jeg liker eller ikke. Som regel er det bra, føler jeg. Hvorfor det?</p>
<p>Lydboken demper støyet litt. Etterpå gjør en podcast det sammen. Jeg kjenner meg takknemlig for denne fluktruten teknologien
gir meg. En annen del av meg lurer på ome jeg kanskje ikke hadde hatt behov for den om den ikke var der. Er den overbestkyttende? Skjermer teknologien 
meg for ting jeg ellers hadde lært meg å håndetere? Bildet av digital teknologi som en slags allestedsværende, overbsekyttende mor 
underholder meg i et sekund eller to.
Det er et fiffig bilde. </p>
<p>Snart kommer det en gruppe mennesker til vannet. Jeg tror de er på min alder. Jeg forsøker å få øyekontakt med dem for å hilse. Det virker på meg som om
de ikke er så interessert i å hilse. Det får for så vidt være greit. De henger opp hengekøyer de også, ved bålplassen. Først blir jeg litt engstelig for
at de også har tenkt til å sove her slik jeg har, og at jeg ikke vil få stedet for meg selv. 
Jeg konkluderer med at det ikker er tilfelle. De har bare to hengekøyer, men er fem. Dessuten har de små sekker, ikke nok til å ha med sovepose. 
Det passer meg godt.</p>
<p>Jeg plages litt av at vi ikke har hilst. Noe er liksom uforøst. et nikk og øyekontakt hadde holdt lenge. Nikk og øyekontakt er akkurat nok
til å få sagt &quot;Hei, her er jeg. Jeg ser det og jeg ser at du ser meg. Aller helst vil jeg vøre ifred, men trenger dere hjelp, er jeg selvsagt
her&quot;. Møter de blikket får de kommunisert &quot;ditto&quot;.</p>
<p>Gruppen oppdager frosker og stålormer i vannet. Ormen er særlig interessant. Den svømmer frem og tilbake i det som
etter hvert har blitt ettermiddagssol. De følger eter den lags vannkanten og tar bilder med telefonene sine.</p>
<p>Hver gang de går forbi meg gjør jeg nye forsøk på øyekontkakt. De unngår den. Det virker som at de har det fint. Hvis det stemmer
er det veldig bra. Jeg har det bra jeg også. Det er mye viktigere enn hilsing.</p>
<p>Egentlig er det veldig fint at fremmede mennesker kan være på samme sted uten å blande seg i hverandres saker. Det tyder på høy tillit.
De lar meg holde på med mitt og jeg lar dem holde på med sitt. Det er en fin ordning. Kanskje er det derfor de ikke hilser? 
Kanskje tenker de at de er nødt til å inkludere meg i deres planer hvis de hilser. Det kan jeg forstå at de ikke vil. 
Det vil ikke jeg heller. Da kan ikke lenger jeg holde på med mitt og det med sitt. Og det er ingen særlig fin ordning.</p>
<p>Når kvelden nærmer seg er det bare meg der. Lydbøkene har tatt slutt og podcastene føler jeg meg ferdig med. Kindle-brettet mitt
har også fått en del oppmerksomhet. Jeg har konsumert masse. Mentalt har disse inndataene tatt meg innom nomadiske reiser til India, debatter om
tilliten til demokratiet blandt befolkingen i Nederland (som er høy, men synkende), til et isolert skogsliv med Elgkalver.</p>
<p>Oppramsning av underholdningsens innhold tydeliggjør hvor mye forskjellig teknologi (bøker språk, lydopptakere, høyttalere, internett) kan
eksponere oss for. Og det på helt ufattelig kort tid! Det er noe magisk med det. Helt fantastisk! I det ene øyeblikket kan jeg høre på 
ledende eksperter diskutere temaet sitt. I det neste kan jeg følge med spanjolenes inntog i Aztekerriket. Fysisk har jeg ikke beveget meg en meter. 
Det er så mektig og omfattende at jeg også tar meg selv i å synes at det er litt skremmende. En slags æresfrykt for teknologien, slik jeg tror 
enkelte troende føler ovenfor Gud.</p>
<p>En annen fantastisk fordel med inndataen er at den lindrer støyen som ellers dominerer hodet. Så fort den tar slutt derimot, har hodet 
fått enda mer materiale å jobbe med. Enda mer å kværne på og lage støy av. Den nye støen forsterker behovet for ny inndata, og plutselig 
befeinner en seg i en evig sirkel. </p>
<p>En midlertidig utvei fra denne sirkelen er å lage ting. Iallfall er dette den beste medisinen meg bekjent. 
Den eneste virkelig store bivirkningen er tretthet. Trettheten leder inn i hvile, som så skaper ny støy og ønske om mer inndata. 
Å lage ting er med andre ord ingen vei ut av den evige sirkelen. Imidlertid er det en måte å omsette støyen i noe som i hvert 
fall har potensiale til å være nyttig. </p>
<p>Det er som en evig informasjonssirkel. Støy -&gt; Inndata - Lage noe -&gt; hvilke -&gt; Repeat. Ny inndata er nødvendig for å få noe UT igjen. 
Iallfall ikke for meg. Og jeg tror det er slik for andre også. Og derfor kommer man seg aldri helt ut av sirkelen.</p>
<p><img src="./../assets/images/modell_overkommelige_eventyr_v1.png" alt="modell"></p>
<p>Her føler jeg et ansvar for å påpeke at denne modellen ikke er vitenskapelig. Det vil si, det vet jeg ikke om den er. Dette kommer mer eller mindre ret fra mitt eget hode.
Jeg har ikke lest meg opp på eksisterende litteratur på kreativitet eller mental støy. Dette er ikke fagfellevurdert. Idet heel tatt. Ikke ta det mer seriøst enn det fortjener.</p>
<p>Vanligvis ville jeg løst behvoet for å lage noe, som jeg nå kjenner her i henegkøyen, med å programmere eller planlegge noe med kalendere og lister. 
Jeg elsker kalendere og lister. De gir en fantastisk oversikt og ro. Avlaster hodet. I tilleg er de megagode verktøy for å faktiskf å ting gjort. 
Det er velbalanserte greier.</p>
<p>Nå har jeg ikke datamaskin til programmering eller lister og kalednder. Noe kunne jeg gjort på ipaden, men jeg mangler mus og tastatur.
Da går det hele tregt og blir mer frustrerende enn nyttig. Jeg vil finne en annen måte å lage noe på.</p>
<p>Med ipaden har jeg en tiløhørende penn. Jeg bestemmer meg for å skrive litt for hånd. Sammenhengende tekst har jeg ikke skrevet 
for hånd på veldig, veldig lenge. Nettbrettet med penn fungerer omtrent som med en aanlog notatbok med blyant. 
Jeg liker at jeg kan gjøre dette analoge digitalt. teknologien har blitt veldog god! Det føles
litt som om jeg bryter reglene for det som skal gå. Som å bruke et magisk papir eller en datamaskin som glemmer at den skal være logisk og ryddig. Det
er morsomt. </p>
<p>Jeg skriver en del i løpet av en vanlig dag. Men det jeg skriver er
stort sett kode, notater, list er eller kommunikasjon med kollegaer. 
De tekstene har som regel et formål. De er guider, søknader eller redegjørelser for et spesielt tema. Slik skriver jeg ikke denne gangen.
Jeg begynner å skrive om prosjektet dagen har bestått og består av. </p>
<p>Riktignok har jeg et tema. Men jeg tillater meg å ta mange omveier på vei til poenget. Deter morsommere å skrive slik. Om ikke annet fordi det
er annerledes sammenlignet med det jeg er vant til. Hvorvidt leseropplevelsen er god eller ikke gjenstår å se.</p>
<p>Arbeidet flyter ganske godt. Iallfall i perider. Når det slutter å flyte, tar jeg pause. Det tar tid. Denne arbeidsteknikken er nok ikke særlig egnet for
tidsfrister og sjefer som venter på en leveranse. I dette teilfellet har jeg dog ingen av deleene, så dette lar jeg meg heller ikke plage av.
Til tross for lange tenkepauser blir det en del tekst. Teksten blir ikke så rent gal heller. Ikke kjempegod. Men bedre enn my annet, synes jeg selv.</p>
<p>I de beste øyeblikkene føler jeg at jeg virkelig greier å være i modellen min; Inndata-steget blir utnyttet i lage noe-steget. 
Det er tilfredsstillende. Mistanken min er at dette skyldes at formen på det jeg lager er likere formen på inndataen jeg mater hjernen 
min med enn det pleier å være.</p>
<p>Apropos modellen lurer jeg på om det mangler et steg for behandling av inforamsjon. Altså et steg som lar hjernen jobbe med inndata uforstyrret.
Dette steget må i så fall vfå plass etter inndata og før man lager noe.</p>
<p><img src="./../assets/images/modell_overkommelige_eventyr_v2.png" alt="modell v2"></p>
<p>Men er ikke dette allerede hvile-steget? jeg lurer på om jeg har laget en liten felle for meg selv her. &quot;Hvile&quot; impliserer at det
ikke skjer noe. Men det tror jeg ikke stemmer. Selv under søvn jobber hjernen med å danne minner og koble om seg selv. Det
er iallfall slik jeg har forstått det når jeg leser og høre på dem som hevder å ha greie på det. Og søvn er jo selve kongen
av hviling. Søvn er hvile-hviling! Muligens bare slått av koma. Og død. men det virker som noe litt annet igjen.</p>
<p>Åja, og det hjernen gjør under søvn er da behandling! Er det ikke? I såfall ser jeg to problemer med den første modellen jeg
tegnet opp.</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Hvile&quot; burde kalles &quot;behandling&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Behandling&quot; må inn to ganger.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="./../assets/images/modell_overkommelige_eventyr_v3.png" alt="modell v3"></p>
<p>Denne modellen tror jeg er nærere virkeligheten. Dessverre ble den litt mindre elegant med et dobbelt steg.
Men det får så være inntil videre.</p>
<p>Å formulere denne tydelige modellen gjør det lettere å tenke rundt prosessen. Det merker jeg med en gang.
Hvis jeg skulle tippe, ville jeg sagt at jeg har svært lett for å havne i støyfasen. Tilsvarende føler jeg meg rimelig trygg
på at jeg bruker for lite tid på behandlingsfasen.</p>
<p>Inndata-fasen er derimot veldig stor. Lage-fasen tenker jeg også paradoksalt nok a t er ganske så stor. Problemet er at
den går på tomgang store deler av tiden. Ikke fordi det mangler på råmateriale, inndata, men fordi behandlingsfasene er for korte. Problemet er at
behandlingsfasene blir til støy-fase så og si med en gang. Og da pøser jeg på med inndata for å lindre det.</p>
<p>Resultatet er et system som delvis går på tomgang, lik en kropp som ikke tar til seg næring samme hvor mye mat den får i seg.</p>
<p>Jeg er langt ute i spekulasjonsland. Modellen er ikke basert på annet enn løse innfall og tanker. Jeg liker den, men jeg er usikker på hvor nyttig
den er. Så var det dette med hva noe skulle være nyttig for, da.. </p>
<p>Istedet for å bli dratt inn i et nytt rekursivt og mentalt nytteprogram blir jeg distrahert.</p>
<p>Det står en rev 50 meter fra meg ,på bålplassen. Den er fin synes jeg. Reven holder god fart gjennom myren. Den hopper liksom gjennom myren. Mykt
hoppende. Uten en eneste lyd.</p>
<p>Jeg ønsker ikke å skremme den. Selv om jeg vet hvor sky rever er, er jeg en smule redd den.</p>
<p>Hvis reven oppdager meg på egenhånd uten å føle seg truet, vil den garantert gå sin vei, tenker jeg. I et forsøk på å skape
nettopp den situasjonen beveger jeg meg litt i soveposen, slik at den lager grove gnisselyder mot underlanget.
Det fungerer. Reven ser mot meg. Jeg unngår øyekontakt. I løpet av et sekund har den listet seg inn skogkanten, 
like stille som den kom. Reven var veldig fin. Jeg lurer på hvor den sover om natten, og hva den tenker om meg.</p>
<p>Jeg sender en melding til samboeren min og ønsker henne en god natt. Jeg håper at hun har det bra der hun er.
Egentlig er jeg ganske sikker på det. Selv om det er veldig fint å være alene, ser jeg frem til å være med henne igjen.</p>
<p>Klokken er knapt fire når jeg våkner. Det er helt lyst. Og jeg er lys våken. Reven viser seg i skogkanten, seks timer siden vi sist 
så hverandre. Det føles passende. Som om vi ønsket hverandre god natt i går og nå ønsker hverandre god morgen. Kanskje er det reven 
som nikker til meg, og sier &quot;Hei, her er jeg. Jeg ser det og jeg ser at du ser meg. Aller helst vil jeg vøre ifred, men trenger du hjelp, er jeg selvsagt
her&quot;. Når jeg ser den får jeg sagt &quot;ditto&quot;.</p>
<p>Frokosten min er en halv flaske smoothie. Jeg pakker sammen utstyret i min trofaste sekk. Og pusser tennene - Det glemte jeg i går.
Til slutt tar jeg farvel med stedet og sier at jeg regner med å komme tilbake.</p>
<p>Jeg følger den blåmerkede stien tilbake til Sognsvann. Fra Kringsjå følger jeg Carl Kjellsens vei og fortsetter opp Frysjaveien, helt til det røde trehuset
med den lille gangbroen over Akerselven. Det er ganske god omvei. Ikke spesielt nyttig.</p>
<p>Når jeg kommer ned til sentrum vil jeg innom det vakre Deichmanske bibliotek. Der skal jeg skrive ut notatene fra i går kveld, tenker jeg.
Se hvordan tankene ender. Eller endte. Hva som er en sannferdig gjenfortelling av eventyrets tanker og hva som er et resultat av ettertidens behandling av dem vet jeg
ikke. Det er flytende grenser jeg ikke tar så alvorlig.</p>
<p>Uansett er det påfallende hvor stor del av dette lille eventyret som kommer fra hodet.
Jeg følger Akerselven helt til Oslofjorden.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: parts of this guide covers a piece of software called Markblog, of which I am the author.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h2>
<p>This guide assumes that you are: </p>
<ul>
<li>familiar with using the command line</li>
<li>familiar with using <code>git</code></li>
<li>someone with a basic understanding of Markdown</li>
<li>a Github user (👋 or <a href="https://github.com/join">become one</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-this-guide-about">What&#39;s this guide about?</h2>
<p>This guide will go through an easy way to get setup a blog. Afterwards, you 
will be able to blog with the following workflow: </p>
<ol>
<li>write markdown-files on your computer ✍️</li>
<li>push your prose to github 🐙</li>
<li>have your blog update automatically 😍</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="whats-the-techstack-briefly">What&#39;s the techstack, briefly?</h2>
<p>To build our blog from Markdown, we will use <a href="https://github.com/olaven/markblog">Markblog</a>. 
This is an open source tool written with <a href="deno.land">Deno</a>. </p>
<p>In order to deploy our website, we will use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Github Pages 
is free and works - unsurprisingly - seamlessly with projects on Github. 
Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a> will be used to automate the 
deployment process. If these tools are unfamiliar, this might seem like a lot. But stick with me, 
it is all relatively simple when it comes together 😅</p>
<h2 id="enough-talk-lets-get-started">Enough talk, let&#39;s get started!</h2>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">install Git</a></li>
<li><a href="https://deno.land/#install">install Deno</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/olaven/markblog#installation">install Markblog</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="git-setup">Git Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li>create a repository on Github (check &quot;Initialize this repository with a README&quot;)</li>
<li>Enable &quot;Github Pages&quot; in the repository settings by setting <code>master</code> as source. </li>
<li>navigate to some fitting folder in your terminal, e.g. <code>cd $HOME/Documents</code></li>
<li>clone your new repo with <code>git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/&lt;your-repository-name&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="blog-setup">Blog Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li>navigate to your cloned repository with <code>cd &lt;your-repository-name&gt;</code></li>
<li>run <code>markblog init</code></li>
<li>(optional) add <code>./style.css</code> to make your page look the way you want</li>
</ol>
<p>Markblog has created two files for you: <code>index.md</code> and <code>./posts</code>. 
Anything you write in <code>index.md</code> will appear on the front-page of your blog. 
<code>./posts</code> is where you will write new posts on your blog. </p>
<h3 id="writing-your-first-post">Writing your first post</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s take a break from the setup, and write something!</p>
<ol>
<li>open the repo-folder in your text editor of choice</li>
<li>in <code>index.md</code>, write a sentence or two about the blog. Or don&#39;t - it&#39;s up to you 🤗</li>
<li>create a new file in <code>./posts</code> called <code>my_first_post.md</code>. </li>
<li>Write something in <code>./posts/my_first_post.md</code>. Or don&#39;t - still up to you 🍨</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="automated-deployment">Automated Deployment</h3>
<p>After this step, we will have achieved the workflow outlined <a href="#whats-this-guide-about">at the beginning</a>!
This section is long and somewhat cumbersome. However, this is automation! In other words,
we only have to do this once!</p>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="https://github.com">Github</a><ol>
<li>Go to your <a href="https://github.com/settings/profile">profile settings</a></li>
<li>Navigate to &quot;Developer settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Personal access tokens&quot; </li>
<li>click &quot;Generate new access token&quot;. This will prompt for your password.</li>
<li>Make sure to check &quot;repo&quot;-access, write a fitting note and click &quot;Generate token&quot;</li>
<li>Keep the token until step 8. Never share it!</li>
<li>head over to the repository you created</li>
<li>Navigate to &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Secrets&quot; and click &quot;Add a new secret&quot;</li>
<li>Add a secret called <code>ACCESS_TOKEN</code>, with the key from step 4.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Locally, in your cloned repository<ol>
<li>create directory for Github Actions with <code>mkdir -p ./github/workflows</code>. </li>
<li>create a workflow-file for deploy with <code>touch ./github/workflows/deploy.yml</code></li>
<li>paste the following into <code>deploy.yml</code>: </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-yml">name: deploy

<p>My goal with this guide is to show how I ended up building a chrome extension with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>. It won&#39;t necessarily fit your use case. But I certainly hope you can draw inspiration from it :-) </p>
<p>To follow this post, you should have <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html">a basic understanding of React</a> as well a little experience with <a href="nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve divided this post into two parts: </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#going-with-a-comfortable-tech-stack">Why I chose the tech stack that I did</a></li>
<li><a href="#lets-actually-make-something">Showing you how to setup the project</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="going-with-a-comfortable-tech-stack">Going with a comfortable tech stack</h2>
<h3 id="i-want-the-type-safety-typescript-can-give-me">I want the type-safety typescript can give me</h3>
<p>My experience is that the benefits of Typescript (or other statically typed languages) outweigh the downsides. 
I especially like how it makes refactoring much easier. 
Typescript screams at you when things are changing. Javascript silently fails. 
The former allows me to constantly search for better ways of expressing the program I&#39;m writing without 
being afraid (too afraid) of breaking something down the line. </p>
<h3 id="react-is-familiar">React is familiar</h3>
<p>Although I prefer to work on backend code, I happen to know React quite well. 
I decided to learn it sometime back in 2017, and stuck with it. When <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">hooks</a> were released, I transitioned into writing functional react components and I have yet to look back. I have no good explanation for why I like this. This way of writing UI and handling state just happens to work well with the way I think. 
Naturally, React was my first choice for writing a browser extension.</p>
<h3 id="lets-try-to-avoid-bloated-configuration-files">Let&#39;s try to avoid bloated configuration files</h3>
<p>Configuration files very quickly become a mess. I find this to be escpecially true in the JS ecosystem. Before knowing it, you end up with a <code>.babelrc</code>, <code>webpack.config.js</code>, <code>package.json</code>, <code>&lt;INSERT_TEST_FRAMEWORK&gt;.config.ts</code>, <code>.eslintrc</code> and so on. </p>
<p>This quickly becomes hard to maintain. Perhaps it shouldn&#39;t be this way, but I mostly find configuration files to be instances of &quot;I have no idea why this works, let&#39;s not touch it&quot;. 
It&#39;s hard to debug and easy to make mistakes. Bad combination. 
(<a href="https://preview.redd.it/a0hf4zzwv4a11.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dad1c1d40783ba976a6d39f994fe423eb305dc5">relevant comic</a>) </p>
<p>I landed on <a href="parceljs.org">Parcel</a> which promises to need zero configuration. And I&#39;ve found this to be largely true. This <a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/will_it_work.png">might bite me some day</a>, but for now I&#39;m happy :-) </p>
<h2 id="lets-actually-make-something">Let&#39;s actually make something!</h2>
<p>Did you just skip to this section? That&#39;s fine. I&#39;d likely have done the same. 
The contents of this section should be enough to create your extension. However, the full source 
code is available <a href="https://github.com/olaven/browser-extension-with-tsx">on Github</a>.  </p>
<h2 id="initialize-and-add-dependencies">Initialize and add dependencies</h2>
<p>We first need to initialize a new project and add the dependencies we need. 
I&#39;ve written a short script with the commands below. 
It boils down to: initialize a project, and add parcel and typescript. </p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">mkdir my_extension_project;
cd my_extension_project; 
yarn init -y; 
yarn add react react-dom 
yarn add --dev typescript parcel @types/react @types/react-dom  @types/chrome;
echo &quot;Extension setup done 🧑‍🚀&quot;;</code></pre>
<p>This script adds <code>&quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;</code> to <code>package.json</code>. Remove this manually.</p>
<h2 id="simple-workflow">Simple Workflow</h2>
<p>This is the workflow we&#39;ll end up with: 
We want a <code>yarn dev</code> command, automatically rebuilding our source code when developing. 
We&#39;ll add a <code>yarn build</code>  command as well, for building our extension for distribution :) </p>
<p>With parcel, these are very simple. Just add the following JSON configuration to the <code>package.json</code> we just created.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">/*..*/
&quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;dev&quot;: &quot;parcel watch src/index.html --public-url=./&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;parcel build src/index.html --public-url=./&quot;
}
/*..*/</code></pre>
<p>You&#39;ll notice that we&#39;re referencing an <code>index.html</code> file in these scripts. 
This will be the entry point of our extension (more on this <a href="#add-your-first-popup">in in a second</a>).</p>
<p>These commands are basically variants on &quot;let parcel look at this file and do all the stuff Babel and Webpack would usually do&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="popups-and-background-scripts">Popups and background scripts</h2>
<p>This is the time to make ourselves familiar with some extension concepts. I&#39;ll keep it short. </p>
<h3 id="popups-are-ui">Popups are UI</h3>
<p>Extension popups define the GUI of our application. That is, 
the visual elements that pop up when you click on the extension. 
If you use a password manager, the popup would be the window where you 
enter your master password and search for the password you want to use. </p>
<h3 id="background-scripts-are-useful-for-interacting-with-the-browser">Background scripts are useful for interacting with the browser</h3>
<p>Background scripts are programs that run independently of the UI or other state in the browser. 
They are useful for handling long term state, e.g. by interacting with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage">storage API</a>. They can also be used to run code on events in the browser. Such 
events can be creation of new windows or navigation between tabs. </p>
<h3 id="telling-the-browser-about-our-extension">Telling the browser about our extension</h3>
<p>The details of the extension is defined in a <code>manifest.json</code> file at the root of our project folder. 
<code>manifest.json</code> tells the browser what our extension should have permission to do and where it&#39;s source files are.
You can <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension#manifest.json">check out MDN</a> for further details. </p>
<p>For now, let&#39;s add a <code>manifest.json</code> looking like this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My First Extension&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;My first browser extension!&quot;,
  &quot;manifest_version&quot;: 2
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="install-your-extension-in-chrome-or-firefox">Install your extension in chrome or firefox</h2>
<p>Before we start making stuff, we want to install our extension in the browser. 
This allows us to see what we&#39;re making.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#39;re using Firefox<ol>
<li>navigate to <code>about:debugging</code> in your browser</li>
<li>click <em>This Firefox</em></li>
<li>click <em>Load temporary Add-on</em></li>
<li>select the <code>manifest.json</code> file in this folder </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you&#39;re using Chrome<ol>
<li>navigate to <code>chrome://extensions</code></li>
<li>enable developer mode in the upper left corner </li>
<li>click <em>Load Unpacked</em> </li>
<li>select the your project directory</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="add-your-first-popup">Add your first popup</h3>
<p>Most of the following should be familiar if you&#39;ve used React before. If you&#39;re confused, refer to the code comments :-)  </p>
<p>The entry point of our application will be <code>index.html</code> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3AYYRqRMC4">classic</a>. 
We&#39;ll add it at <code>src/index.html</code> as this matches with the <a href="#simple-workflow">build script</a> we added in <code>package.json</code> earlier.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- The root node of our component tree --&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;!-- The entry point for our React components --&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;./components/index.tsx&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, let&#39;s add a <code>./src/components/index.tsx</code>. This file will load our react component. </p>
<pre><code class="language-tsx">
import * as React from &quot;react&quot;; 
import * as ReactDOM from &quot;react-dom&quot;; 

//This is our counter component 
const Counter = () =&gt; {
    const [ count, setCount ] = React.useState(0);
    return &lt;&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;{count}&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; {setCount(count + 1)}}&gt;increment&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; {setCount(count - 1)}}&gt;decrement&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
}

/* We&#39;re now telling React to render this component on the webpage, inside 
the first element it can find with and id of &quot;root&quot;. Notice how this matches 
the `div`-tag in our `index.html` :-) */
ReactDOM.render(&lt;Counter /&gt;, document.getElementById(&quot;root&quot;));</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, the browser needs to know about our popup to show it. 
As <a href="#telling-the-browser-about-our-extension">just discussed</a>, this is done through our <code>manifest.json</code> file. 
Simply add the following to it: </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">/*...*/
&quot;browser_action&quot;: {
  &quot;default_popup&quot;: &quot;dist/index.html&quot;
}
/*...*/</code></pre>
<p>Notice how we&#39;re referencing <code>dist/index.html</code> and not <code>src/index.html</code>. This is because 
parcel creates and leaves our files in the <code>dist</code>-directory when it is done transforming our Typescript and React code to 
plain <code>.js</code>-files :-) </p>
<h3 id="did-it-work">Did it work?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s time to see our beautiful creation!
Open a terminal and run <code>yarn dev</code>. You should see a message like <code>✨ Built in 58ms</code>. </p>
<p>Now open your browser, and click on your extension. There it is! Or should be.
If something went wrong, read the error message carefully and try to figure out what&#39;s 
going on. You can always refer to <a href="https://github.com/olaven/browser-extension-with-tsx">the full solution</a> if you&#39;re stuck.</p>
<p>While you&#39;re at it, try to make a change in your component. Notice how the change is picked up in the browser at once. Parcel has rebuilt our source files automatically :-)</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-background-script">Adding a background script</h3>
<p>Now that we have our popup working, lets try to add a background script as well. 
<a href="#background-scripts-are-useful-for-interacting-with-the-browser">As mentioned</a>, these can (amongst other things) be used to listen for browser events. To demonstrate this, we&#39;ll create a script that logs the id of a tab whenever we create one!</p>
<p>First, create the file at <code>src/background/script.ts</code> with the following code: </p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">
//Every time a tab is created...
chrome.tabs.onCreated.addListener((tab) =&gt; {
    //run this code 
    console.log(`You just created a tab with id: ${tab.id}`)
}); </code></pre>
<p>Like with popups, we have to tell the browser about this through <code>manifest.json</code>: </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">/*..*/
&quot;background&quot;: {
  &quot;scripts&quot;: [
    &quot;dist/background/script.js&quot;
  ]
}
/*..*/</code></pre>
<p>Again, we&#39;re referencing the <code>dist</code> folder where Parcel leaves our files. 
You might recall that background scripts <a href="#background-scripts-are-useful-for-interacting-with-the-browser">run separately</a>. 
In other words, our popup knows nothing of this background script. Hence, we have to explicitly tell Parcel to include this file. 
Do this by editing the <code>&quot;dev&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;build&quot;</code> commands in <code>package.json</code> like this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">/*..*/
&quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;dev&quot;: &quot;parcel watch src/index.html src/background/script.ts --public-url=./&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;parcel build src/index.html src/background/script.ts --public-url=./&quot;
}
/*..*/</code></pre>
<p>Since we&#39;ve modified our <code>dev</code>-script, we need to stop and restart it in the terminal window.</p>
<p>We&#39;re almost ready to see our background script in action! 
We just need to access the console where the <code>console.log</code>&#39;s are written. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#39;re using Firefox<ol>
<li>navigate to &quot;about:config&quot; and add <code>extensions.sdk.console.logLevel</code> with a string value of <code>&quot;all&quot;</code></li>
<li>restart Firefox</li>
<li>Open to Tools -&gt; Web developer -&gt; Browser console (alternatively use cmd+shift+j)</li>
<li>Click the settings icon and enable Show Content Messages</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you&#39;re using Chrome <ul>
<li>navigate to &quot;chrome://extensions&quot;</li>
<li>click on &quot;background page&quot; on your extension (you might need to hit the refresh button for this to show up)  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should now see the console for your background script! Open your browser and console side by side and create a few tabs. 
The handler is running and <code>You just created a tab with id: N</code> gets logged ✨</p>
<h2 id="see-browser-vendors-for-publishing">See browser vendors for publishing</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not going to cover how to publish your extensions here. 
This blog post covers a lot already. Browsers themselves have guides for this.
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/">Here&#39;s one the one for Chrome</a> and <a href="https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/">here&#39;s the same for Firefox</a>. </p>

<p>Thank you for reading. It really means a lot to me.
Hopefully this gave you enough knowledge to start experimenting with extensions for yourself.
