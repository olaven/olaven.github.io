# A dialy note taking system 
How I stay sane when working. 

## Daily notes following the same structure 
* writing daily 
* Blocking of time in my calendar 
* following a template 
* getting thoughts out of my head -> quality is not really that important 

## I've found it helps to externalize your ideas 
* looking at ideas from the outside 
* having an objective truth to what you once thought 

## Giving myself concrete soltuions to the problems I discover 
* Asking what problems I've had and telling myself how to avoid them in the future 
* Looking back in the evening 

## How I'm doing this in practice 
* probably 100 ways to do this. This is how i happen to do it 
* Foam 
* template under `./templates` 
* Creating a new note with `yyyy-mm-dd.md` every morning, using foam commands
